Image Classifier

The classifier.py is the script that uses VGG16 pretrained model to classify the image. This program uses Tensorflow as backend.

In order to execute this program you need to type python classifier.py "PATH TO THE IMAGE". Replace "PATH TO IMAGE" with the path to the image you want to classify.

In order to see a test example I have provided a image in images folder just type " python classifier.py ./images/turtle.jpg " in your terminal or command prompt.

Requirements:
1. Tensorflow
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy
